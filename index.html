					<p>The bowline is an ancient and simple knot used to form a fixed loop at the end of a rope. It has the virtues of being both easy to tie and untie; most notably, it is easy to untie after being subjected to a load.</p> Read more…

					<p>It is very important in both sailing and rock climbing as a method of stopping ropes from running out of retaining devices. Like the overhand knot, which will jam under strain, often requiring the rope to be cut, the figure of eight will also jam, but is usually more easily undone than the overhand knot.</p> Read more…

				<h2>Did You Know?</h2>
				<p>When lines are of unequal diameter or rigidity it is necessary for security to <strong>double</strong> the sheet bend by making <strong>an additional round turn</strong> below the first and again bringing the working end back under itself. The free ends should end up on the same side of the knot for maximum strength.</p> Learn more about the double sheet bend…

					<p>Ashley says, <blockquote cite="https://ashleyknots.com/"><q>This book describes every practical knot, what it looks like, where it comes from, and how to tie it.</q> The book includes 4,000 knots, with all the varieties of shipboard knots as well as knots used by butchers, steeplejacks, electric linesmen, knitters, cobblers, surgeons, poachers<a href="footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> and cattle rustlers.</p>
